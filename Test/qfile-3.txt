Now it's easier than ever to interact with the world's largest social network.
And there's no need to leave your app to do it. Share a photo to Facebook right from Camera or Photos. 
Post your location right from Maps. Brag about a high score right from Game Center. 
If you have your hands full, just ask Siri to post for you. 
You need to sign in to Facebook only once, and you'll be off and sharing. 
Never miss another birthday or get-together, 
since Facebook events are integrated into Calendar. And your Facebook friends' profile information is
 integrated into Contacts, so when they update an email address or phone number you automatically 
stay up to date. Now that's something to post about.

Share photos from the Camera app, locations from Maps, links from Safari, 
high scores from Game Center, and more. Or post a status update from Notification Center or with Siri.
Share links.
